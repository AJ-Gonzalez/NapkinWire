## [Later] Feedback tooling
*Added: 2025-09-12 12:05 UTC*
MCP integrated user feedback tool. Send optionally anonymous messages through LLM tool call. Capture feedback and announce new releases/features on GitHub. Example: 'napkinwire needs a tool for connecting to databases. Sent from claude code 4 sonnet.'

## [Later] Security audit tooling
*Added: 2025-09-12 12:05 UTC*
LLM call via OpenRouter to cheap model for code analysis. Look for vulnerabilities across codebase. Will need code sanitization.
---

## [Soon] OpenRouter and self-hosted LLM support
*Added: 2025-09-12 12:05 UTC*
Support for OpenRouter and self-hosted models via OpenAI API format. Enable cheaper models for routine tasks and local/VPS hosted alternatives.
---

## [Later] RAG for language reference and style guides
*Added: 2025-09-12 12:05 UTC*
Add Chroma DB or similar vector database for language references and style guides. Needs to be performant on CPU-only local machines. Use for maintaining coding standards across AI assistants.
---

## [Soon] Test coverage and code quality audit utility
*Added: 2025-09-12 12:05 UTC*
Run test coverage, linters, etc. Auto-generate tests as needed. Provide actionable items ranked by priority for code quality improvements.
---

## [Next] Venn diagram set notation editor
*Added: 2025-09-12 12:05 UTC*
Visual set theory tool for data filtering. Draw Venn diagrams that output formal set notation like (A âˆ© B) \ C for pipeline operations and SQL generation.
---

## [Later] Neovim MCP client integration
*Added: 2025-09-12 12:05 UTC*
MCP client for Neovim using Lua. Enable AI assistance directly in editor with commands like :NapkinTicket, :NapkinAsk. Full flow state without leaving vim.
