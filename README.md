From sketch to prompt in seconds.

**[Try it here!](https://www.napkinwire.lat/)** | **[Demo Video](#demo)** | **[Examples](#examples)**

## What it does

Sketch UI layouts with simple rectangles and instantly get LLM-ready prompts. No accounts, no subscriptions, no BS.

**The problem:** Describing UI layouts to LLMs (or humans) in text is terrible. "Put a button on the right side, below the form, but not too close to the footer..." ü§Æ

**The solution:** Draw rectangles. Get perfect prompts. Build your UI.

## Why this exists

Built because I needed to mock up UIs quickly for AI coding workflows. Started sketching on actual napkins, realized this could be better.

I wanted the feeling of sketching ideas on the back of a napkin or whiteboard - dead simple, no friction between idea and communication.

**Real world usage:** I used NapkinWire to design NapkinWire's own homepage. It worked on the first try.

## Demo

*[Video/GIF placeholder - showing sketch ‚Üí copy prompt ‚Üí paste in LLM ‚Üí generated code]*

## How it works

1. **Draw rectangles** on a canvas (mobile-friendly)
2. **Purple rectangles** become text content areas  
3. **Label** what goes in each area ("User avatar", "Article title", etc.)
4. **Copy prompt** that actually works with ChatGPT, Claude, Cursor, etc.
5. **Generate code** in your LLM of choice

## Examples

### UI mockup

```
Create this GUI using Vanilla JS with Tailwind CSS, it will be used for a Login form for my landing page

Content areas:
Text Area 1: Username or email field
Text Area 2: password field
Text Area 3: captcha (will add later) use placeholder text
Text Area 4: Log in button
Text Area 5: Sign in button


Please create a functional interface that matches this layout exactly. Use the visual structure shown in the ASCII art as your guide for positioning and proportions.

Additional requirements: 

Dark theme with blue accents. 
No rounded corners. 
```

### Diagram that the LLM can understand.

```
Create a login form using React with the following layout:

[Generated ASCII layout]

Content areas:
1: Company logo - centered header branding
2: Email input field - user email entry
3: Password input field - secure password entry  
4: Login button - primary action button

Additional requirements: Clean, modern styling with proper form validation.
```
