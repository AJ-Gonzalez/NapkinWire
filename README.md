From sketch to prompt in seconds.

**[Try it here!](https://www.napkinwire.lat/)** | **[Demo Video](#demo)** | **[Examples](#examples)**

## What it does

Sketch UI layouts with simple rectangles and instantly get LLM-ready prompts. No accounts, no subscriptions, no BS.

**The problem:** Describing UI layouts to LLMs (or humans) in text is terrible. "Put a button on the right side, below the form, but not too close to the footer..." 🤮

**The solution:** Draw rectangles. Get perfect prompts. Build your UI.

## Why this exists

Built because I needed to mock up UIs quickly for AI coding workflows. Started sketching on actual napkins, realized this could be better.

I wanted the feeling of sketching ideas on the back of a napkin or whiteboard - dead simple, no friction between idea and communication.

**Real world usage:** I used NapkinWire to design NapkinWire's own homepage. It worked on the first try.

## Demo

*[Video/GIF placeholder - showing sketch → copy prompt → paste in LLM → generated code]*

## How it works

1. **Draw rectangles** on a canvas (mobile-friendly)
2. **Purple rectangles** become text content areas  
3. **Label** what goes in each area ("User avatar", "Article title", etc.)
4. **Copy prompt** that actually works with ChatGPT, Claude, Cursor, etc.
5. **Generate code** in your LLM of choice

## Examples

These are the sample of each demo Gif.

### UI mockup

Create this GUI using Vanilla JS with Tailwind CSS, it will be used for a Login form for my landing page
