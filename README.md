# NapkinWire

From sketch to prompt in seconds.

## What it does

Sketch UI layouts with simple rectangles and instantly get LLM-ready prompts. No accounts, no subscriptions, no BS.

## Why this exists

Built because I needed to mock up UIs quickly and LLMs are terrible at understanding vague descriptions. Humans aren't much better either.

I wanted the feeling of sketching ideas on the back of a napkin or whiteboard - dead simple, no friction between idea and communication.

## How it works

1. Draw rectangles on a canvas
2. Purple rectangles become text content areas
3. Label what goes in each area
4. Get a prompt that actually works with ChatGPT, Claude, etc.

## Features

- Works on mobile (PWA installable)
- Touch drawing support
- Multiple layout formats (desktop, mobile, square)
- Generates prompts for GUI and TUI frameworks
- Copy to clipboard with one click

## Anti-features

- No user accounts
- No data collection  
- No subscription fees
- No complex design tools
- No learning curve

## Usage

Just start drawing. Everything updates automatically as you sketch.
